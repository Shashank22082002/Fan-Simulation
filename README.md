# Fan-Simulation
A simulation of Table fan in C++ using opengL library and GLUT, for the computer graphics assignment.
Following functionalities are expected.
1.) On key press of ‘s’, the fan should start spinning the blades.

2.) On key press of ‘t’, the fan should stop.

3.) In addition to the rotation of the blades, on key press of ‘h’, lateral/horizontal movement of
    the blades (left-right-left movement as in video) should be implemented.
    
4.) On pressing ‘u’ (up), ‘d’(down), ‘l’(left) and ‘r’(right), the fan should start moving up, down, left
    and right respectively on the current wall its located in.
    
5.) Besides the fan on a wall, you need to construct a room with three of four walls , ceiling, floor
    and at least another object.
    
6.) You should also develop options to view the fan from different perspectives.

7.) On window resize, the aspect ratio needs to be maintained.

8.) On key press of ‘q’, your application should quit.\
